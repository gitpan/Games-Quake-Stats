Games-Quake-Stats version 0.05
==============================

This module provides simple mechanisms for collecting and displaying game
statisitics for the Quake, Quake2, Quake2world, and Quake 3 games.   It works by 
reading the fraglog file created by Quake servers.

You can specify the fraglog file when the object is constructed, the module
compiles statistics for each player that appears in the log.

The Games::Quake::Stats module can create simple bar charts showing
the relative statistics of each player, and can generate textual and pre-formed
HTML output (HTML output shows the graphs created).


Example Usage
=============================

 use strict;
 use Games::Quake::Stats;
 
 # NOTE: 
 # 
 # This example supposes you want to use this module in a CGI setting.
 #
 #
 # If you configure your quake-server to write a fraglog in the directory 
 # where the quake-server is run, you can create a symbolic link from the
 # fraglog file to the file: /var/www/cgi-bin/fraglog.log (if that is where this
 # CGI application will reside).  This code will then read the statistics data
 # from the *actual* file, while the quake-server deals only with a symbolically
 # linked file.
 #
 my $quake_stats = Stats->new(_frag_log => "/var/www/cgi-bin/fraglog.log",
			      _stats_graph => "/var/www/html/stats/chart.jpg",
			      _skill_graph => "/var/www/html/stats/skill.jpg");
					   


 # number of times player 'player1' has been scored against
 my $player1_fragged = $stats->times_fragged("player1");


 # number of times player 'player1' has scored against 'player2'
 my $player_total = $stats->total_frags("player1", "player2");
 

 # total frags player 'player1' has scored
 my $player_total = $stats->total_frags("player1");
 

 # skill level of player 'player1' (total_scored/times_scored_against);
 my $player_skill = $stats->skill_level("player1");




 # create graphs					   
 $quake_stats->generate_stats_graph(); # or, generate_stats_graph("/var/www/html/stats/stats.jpg");
 $quake_stats->generate_skill_graph();


 # If you are using this code as a CGI response:
 print "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n";    

 # Usually create graphs before calling this (as this example did above)
 $quake_stats->generate_html("http://www.youraddress.net/stats/");

 exit (0);
